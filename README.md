## Project Goals

The main goal in five words:
```
Write clean and good code
```

Deploy a simply game to explore some of the existing design patterns in **Java**.
Some of the design patterns used are **Command**, **Factory** and  **Singleton**.
To check every situation where the design pattern was used, check the [Report](./docs/README.md) file.

The code were structured based on the **MVC architecture** and **SOLID** principles were followed.

To make the code even cleaner, some **refactoring techniques** were used for the refactorings made.

Another big goal of the project was to write appropriate tests for the code.
To do this, **Spock** was used.


## The game

The game is inspired by the Flappy Bird.
The objective of the game is to maneuver a small tiger through a series of walls coming from the right and pass through the gap to score a point.
The player can collect collectables, that give points or start a god mode, where the gap between the walls is increased, making the game easier.
